# Defective-Rail-Classification-from-Track-Images
 Propose a deep learning-based approach for detecting defective rails from track images. Based on EfficientNet(a convolutional neural network architecture) to bulid, train and evaluate a model, which is used to classify track images as either healthy or defective rails, achieving a high accuracy in classifying.

# Overview
Railways are the backbone of the transportation industry, providing a reliable and cost-effective means of moving goods and people across long distances. However, with millions of tons of cargo and thousands of passengers being transported each day, railway safety is of paramount importance. One of the most critical components of railway safety is the track itself, and any defects or issues with the track can lead to serious accidents.
One common issue with railway tracks is defective rails, which can cause derailments and other accidents. Detecting and classifying defective rails is a challenging task, as it requires visual inspection of thousands of miles of track, which can be time-consuming and expensive. With the recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning, however, it is now possible to automate this process using images captured from track inspections.
The identification of defective rails is a crucial maintenance activity for railway tracks, as it represents one of the primary failure modes. Track defects pose significant safety risks and can result in service disruptions, which can have adverse economic consequences. Timely detection and correction of such defects can yield significant safety and economic benefits, including a reduction in accidents and minimization of traffic interruptions.
In this project, I propose a deep learning-based approach for detecting defective rails from track images. I use EfficientNet, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, to classify track images as either healthy or defectiverails. I trained and evaluated my model on a large dataset of track images, achieving high accuracy in classifying defective rails.
My approach has the potential to significantly reduce the time and cost involved in inspecting railway tracks, while improving safety by detecting defective rails before they cause accidents. In this project report, I provide a detailed description of my approach and methodology, as well as insights into the challenges and opportunities of using EfficientNet for defective rail classification. I also discuss the implications of my results for the safety and efficiency of railway systems.
